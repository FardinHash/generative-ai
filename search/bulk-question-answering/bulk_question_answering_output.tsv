As to our Other Bets, for the full year 2021, revenues were <b>$753 million</b>. The operating loss was $5.3 billion for the full year 2021 versus an operating loss of $4.5 billion in 2020. Let me close with some comments on our outlook.

off as we help customers with their digital transformation. You can see that Google Cloud revenues increased by 47% for the full year 2021 compared to 2020, with GCP revenues continuing to grow at a faster rate than Cloud overall.

The increase was primarily driven by strength in AdMob, AdSense and Google Ad Manager. Google Network revenues increased $6.7 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses of $725 million, largely resulting from a 12% increase in headcount. R&amp;D expenses increased $2.3 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

advertising revenues contributed to the year-over-year increase. Revenues from the United States, EMEA, APAC, and Other Americas were $29.8 billion, $19.8 billion, $11.7 billion, and $3.7 billion, respectively.

Google Cloud Our Google Cloud revenues increased $1.5 billion and $4.4 billion from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. The growth was primarily driven by GCP followed by Google Workspace offerings.

As of September 30, 2021, the amount not yet recognized as revenues from these commitments was $37.1 billion. We expect to recognize approximately half over the next 24 months with the remaining thereafter.

Google ServicesGoogle advertising revenuesOur advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network partners' properties(""Google Network properties"") and the correlation between these items, have been affected and may continue to beaffected by various factors, including:• advertiser competition for keywords;• changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;• changes in device mix;• changes in foreign currency exchange rates;• fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;• general economic conditions including the impact of COVID-19;• seasonality; and• traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertisingverticals and channels.Our advertising revenue growth rate has been affected over time as a result of a number of factors, includingchallenges in maintaining our growth rate as revenues increase to higher levels; changes in our product mix;changes in advertising quality or formats and delivery; the evolution of the online advertising market; increasingcompetition; our investments in new business strategies; query growth rates; and shifts in the geographic mix of ourrevenues. We also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences,the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices and modalities, ourability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currencyexchange rates.Google advertising revenues consist primarily of the following:• Google Search & other consists of revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenuesfrom traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search inbrowsers, toolbars, etc.) and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, andGoogle Play;• YouTube ads consists of revenues generated on YouTube properties; and• Google Network consists of revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob,AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.Google Search & otherGoogle Search & other revenues increased $11.6 billion and $33.5 billion from the three and nine monthsended September 30, 2020 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. The overallgrowth was primarily driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth inuser adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, growth in advertiser spending, and improvements we havemade in ad formats and delivery. The adverse effect of COVID-19 on prior year comparable period revenues alsocontributed to the year-over-year increase.

Historically, we included certain viewed YouTube engagement ads and therelated revenues in our paid clicks and cost-per-click monetization metrics. Over time, advertising on YouTube hasexpanded to multiple advertising formats and the type of viewed engagement ads historically included in paid clicksand cost-per-click metrics have increasingly covered a smaller portion of YouTube advertising revenues. As a result,beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, we removed these ads and the related revenues from the paid clicks andcost-per-click metrics. The revised metrics presented below provide a better understanding of monetization trendson the properties included within Google Search & other, as they now more closely correlate with the relatedchanges in revenues.Impressions for Google Network properties include impressions displayed to users served on Google Networkproperties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense and Google Ad Manager.Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents theaverage amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of

Google search and other advertising revenues of $43.3 billion in the quarter, were up36%, with broad-based strength across our business, led again by strong growth in retail.YouTube advertising revenues of $8.6 billion, were up 25%, reflecting strength in both directresponse and brand advertising. The deceleration in the growth rate vs the third quarter of 2021was driven primarily by lapping a strong recovery in brand in the fourth quarter of 2020. Networkadvertising revenues of $9.3 billion, were up 26%, driven by AdMob.

Throughout these difficult times, Googlers have remainedfocused on delivering helpful services for users and partners, as well as on driving innovation forlong-term growth.In terms of outlook by segment, for Google Services, we are very pleased with our year-on-yearrevenue growth in Q4 and for the full year 2021, which continued to be driven by broad-basedadvertiser strength and strong consumer online activity. The year on year growth rate alsoreflected a benefit from lapping COVID-related weakness in 2020, which obviously will not be afactor in 2022.

Starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services Revenues were $61.4 billion,up 2%.Across our advertising revenues, the year-over-year deceleration in growth rates versus thethird quarter of last year was largely driven by lapping very strong performance, most notably inSearch and Other revenues. Additionally, the year-on-year deceleration on YouTube andNetwork reflects a pullback in spend by some advertisers, as we first noted last quarter.In terms of the revenue lines, Google Search and Other advertising revenues of $39.5 billion inthe quarter were up 4%. YouTube advertising revenues of $7.1 billion were down 2%. Networkadvertising revenues of $7.9 billion were down 2%.Other Revenues were $6.9 billion, up 2%, reflecting several factors: First, subscriber growth inYouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV continued to drive ongoing strong growth inYouTube non-advertising revenues; second, we delivered solid growth in hardware revenues,primarily from sales of the Pixel 6a.Finally, the growth in these two areas was offset by a year-on-year decline in Play revenues,reflecting a slowdown in buyer spend due to a number of factors, including lower engagementlevels in gaming compared with earlier stages of the pandemic.In terms of costs within Google Services, TAC was $11.8 billion, up 3%.Google Services Operating income was $19.8 billion, down 17%, and the operating margin was32%.Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $6.9 billion for the second [sic] thirdquarter, up 38%.GCP’s revenue growth was again greater than Cloud’s, reflecting significant growth in bothinfrastructure and platform services.
