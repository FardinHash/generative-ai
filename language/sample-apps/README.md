## (Optional) Using the Custom Samples via Cloud Code for VS Code plugin

If you would prefer not to use Cloud Shell and would like to utilize a Developer IDE like VS Code, we are provided support for importing and running/deploying these applications within your IDE environment.

[Cloud Code for VS Code](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/vscode) provides IDE support for the full development cycle of Kubernetes and Cloud Run applications, from creating a cluster to running your finished application. We are providing the entire list of applications in the form of custom applications that you can import directly into VS Code in which you have configured Cloud Code.

Assuming that you have Visual Studio Code and the Cloud Code plugin setup, click on the Cloud Code link in the status bar.

- Click on New Application
- Select Custom Application
- When asked for the Git Repository URL, enter the URL of this repository: [https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/language/sample-apps](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/language/sample-apps)
- You will shown all the projects. Select one of your choice.
- Complete the rest of the steps to import the projects into Visual Studio Code.
